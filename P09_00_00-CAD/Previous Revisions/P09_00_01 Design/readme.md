Name: P09_00_01 CAD Design
Software Version: FreeCAD 0.15
Notes: Design superseded by P09_00_02
Comments: The stepper motor was not powerful enough to rotate the LED with the lead wires attached. Other design features worked well and were kept.

Description:
This design is the second iteration of P90_00_00. It calls for one SG90 servo to control the owl head movement and one micro stepper motor for the beacon motion. The SG90 servo is modified for continuous rotation and is directly connected to the owl head. The continuous rotation modification disallows for the usage of the SG90 potentiometer so a DIY one is designed to fit with the owl body and head section. The potentiometer makes use of 26GA nichrome wire which will also be needed.

Assembly: The parts aligned to check for interference
BeaconLens: The red lens that covers the LED on top of the owl's head (unmodified since P09_00_00)
LEDMount: The mounting part that mates the stepper motor with the LED
StepperMast: Part that holds the stepper motor vertically and mates to the BeaconBase to ensure the mast is centered (unmodified since P09_00_00R2)
BeaconBase: Top part of the potentiometer and base for stepper mast. Placed inside of owl head 
ServoHead: Attachment part that mates the servo to the top part of the potentiometer 
MainFrame: The main frame component where the servo is attached to the owl body. Also comprises of the bottom half of the potentiometer
BottomPlate: Support plate for drive servo and other electronics. Goes in the bottom half of owl timer (unmodified since P09_00_00R3)

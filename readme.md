### Description  
P09_00_00 OwlBuddy
This project is a simple modify but not repurpose hack. I'm taking a mechanical owl timer that doesn't work very well and converting it into a digital animatronics timer.  
Features
 * Adjustable timing between 1-60 min
 * Servo motion for head movement
 * Detection of timing adjustment
 * Audio feedback
 * LED strobe beacon
 * Battery powered
 * Charge level monitoring
 * Integrated USB charging
 * Automatic sleep and wakeup

### Notes to user
 * Project documented at https://kionokitse.wordpress.com/owlbuddy
 * In development
 
### Hardware
 * Arduino Pro Mini clone ATmega328 5V

### What's next
 * Learning how to use 3D printer
 * Get components
 
 
### Notebook
 * Battery source Li-Po, Li-ion, or Ni-Mh. Ni-Mh has a similar capacity to Li-ion and weight isn't an issue. I already have these batteries and a simple USB charger for them. Size is a little big but it can fit more or less.  
 * Ni-Mh won't work the voltage is too low max voltage is 2.4

 * Direct control of mini stepper motor			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaByP2w_vtA
 * Idea for slip ring power for LED strobe		https://gizmoplans.com/product/wind-turbine-slip-rings/
 * Interesting page on li-po charging			https://electronics-project-hub.com/arduino-lithium-ion-battery-charger/
